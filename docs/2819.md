实验室已经有3个人转走，在组内的每一个都想转走，博后来之前先要做3个月volunteer,也就是不给工资白干。学生评价：没人性，做人不地道，冷酷，抠门，经常拿学生毕业做威胁，暗示等，晚上干到12点是家常便饭，周末加班，夜里11点给你发邮件，出差不让坐飞机，最经常提的是那个cheap, 这个cheap和 I don\'t care.
系里名声差，众所周知，隔壁系的学生也知道。学生谈话，都要录音，因为经常说话不算话。在白人教授面前卑躬屈膝，谄媚像个狗一样；在其它国际学生面前尽量表现；在自己学生面前装逼。

各位从国内来的学生，一定要了解自己的导师的人品，再做决定！千万记住，是人品，不是学术能力等，决定了你博士几年是否过的愉快。
