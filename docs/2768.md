## Samuel Sia

学校：Columbia University

院系：Biomedical Engineering Department

* * *

评分：1.5

导师辨识特征：Everyone called him Sam, and his office locates at Mudd 363 of the Morningside campus

学术水平：He thinks prett high of himself and always claims one should focus on one topic and keep digging, but that is actually only what he uses to disguise that fact that he couldn\'t catch up with the field frontiers anymore. He wants to publish big now, which however only slows down the overall publication speed of the lab

师生关系：Arrogant, refuse to listen to you, hard to work with
